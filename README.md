### How to run this app

`HINT: (For easier application setup I has kept the .env file in directory and commited it to the repository. Don't repeat it on your projects.)`
1. Clone repository at your local machine.
2. Make sure you have `docker` and `docker-compose` commands available.
3. Make sure `.env` variables are correctly set. Use .env.example 
4. Make sure that port `3002` is available. Main application will be run on that port. You can specify other port as an environment variable.
5. Run `docker-compose up -d`
6. Enjoy. For general overview take a look at API documentation: `http://localhost:3002/api-docs`
